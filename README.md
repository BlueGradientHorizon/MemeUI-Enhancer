## Notes 📝

- This is a module, so you will need to flash it. It works on Magisk, KernelSU, and APatch.
- You can find the `mienhancer.log` file in Internal Storage/Android. It will show you the types of tweaks MemeUI Enhancer has applied.
- The device may overheat while the tweaks are being executed, but there's no need to worry. The overheating will subside after some time, once the tweaks are fully completed.

## Monetization-free experience 🚫

The original author of this module, [iamlooper](https://github.com/iamlooper) had included Internet bandwidth monetization SDK ([PacketSDK](https://www.packetsdk.com/)) binaries into his module, and it is clearly noted in his repository ([original disclosure](https://telegra.ph/Disclosure-09-16)). Although I am respectful to him for this module, I don't want any other 3rd party programs constantly running in the background without any easy ways to control them.
